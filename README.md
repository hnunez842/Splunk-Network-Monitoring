# Splunk Network Monitoring

## Objective

Me and my team developed a comprehensive baseline for monitoring network activity within a company using Splunk, focusing on two key areas: 
Apache web server logs and activity within a Windows environment. 

By analyzing log data, including login failures, suspicious activity, and signature-based patterns, we were able to establish an effective baseline for creating alerts and generating reports. 
This baseline was then used to assess attack logs and gain insights into ongoing network activity, helping to identify and investigate potential security incidents.


## Skills Developed

- **Log Analysis & Correlation**  
  Analyzed Apache web server logs and Windows event logs to identify patterns such as failed logins, suspicious activity, and signature-based indicators.

- **Splunk Search & Query (SPL)**  
  Wrote and optimized Splunk queries to filter, aggregate, and correlate events, supporting both baseline creation and investigation of attack activity.

- **Baseline Creation for Security Monitoring**  
  Established a “normal” activity baseline for web and Windows environments to distinguish legitimate behavior from potential threats.

- **Alerting & Detection Engineering**  
  Designed alert conditions based on log patterns (e.g., excessive login failures, abnormal access activity) to support early detection of security incidents.

- **Dashboarding & Reporting**  
  Built visualizations and reports in Splunk to present findings, track ongoing activity, and support incident investigation and decision-making.

## Tools Used

- **Splunk** – Centralized platform for log ingestion, search, correlation, alerting, and reporting.
- **Apache Web Server Logs** – Source of HTTP access and error data used to identify abnormal web activity.
- **Windows Event Logs** – Used to monitor authentication events and system activity within a Windows environment.
- **Sample Attack / Security Event Logs** – Leveraged simulated or captured attack logs to test the baseline, validate alerts, and analyze potential security incidents.
